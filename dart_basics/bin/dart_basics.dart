/*
1. Develop a Dart program with a non-nullable String variable to capture user email input. 
   Implement validation logic to ensure the email contains exactly one '@' symbol and 
   at least one dot '.' appearing after the '@' character. Avoid using regular expressions 
   for validation.
*/

/*
2. Build a Dart application featuring a getUsername(int num) function that returns a 
   random name if even number is passed and returns null for odd number is passed. Execute this function 
   10 times in a loop, and print all non-null results in uppercase and print "NA" for null results. 
*/

/*
3. Design a Student class containing the following attributes: rollNo, student name, 
   departmentName, age, gender, and dateOfBirth. Implement a default constructor, 
   then instantiate an object with sample data and display the object's information.
*/

/* 
4. Extend the Student class implementation by adding multiple constructor types: 
   named parameterized constructor, positional constructor, named constructor, 
   and factory constructor.
*/

/*
5. Make Student calss memebers private and write setters and getters with validatiosn if required.
*/

/*
6. Implement a Dart method that returns a Future<String> with a 10-second delay. 
   Create a program that demonstrates calling this method using both synchronous 
   (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) approaches, printing the result 
   in each case.
